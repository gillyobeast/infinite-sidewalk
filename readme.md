When watching a Numberphile video, released recently and featuring Neil Sloane of OEIS fame, Brady relayed a problem from Jane Street relating to a number of stones. The problem is as follows:

Suppose you have a line of stones, numbered `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4,...`. When you are on a stone labelled `k`, you can jump `k` stones in either direction. What is the minimal number of jumps required to reach the `n`th square?
